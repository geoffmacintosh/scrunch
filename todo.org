#+TITLE: Scrunch: Game Plan

* [0/5] Fixes
** TODO [[file:lib/scrunch/meta.rb::def%20self.get_metadata(file)][Meta.get_metadata]]
- [ ] Change the name of Meta.get_metadata to Meta.get
- [ ] Describe what the regex in Meta.get_metadata does
- [ ] Add support to get the series number metadata (includes Meta.apply_metadata)

** TODO [[file:lib/scrunch/meta.rb::def%20self.get_cover(input_file)][Meta.get_cover]]
- [ ] I have no idea what that regex matches. Find out.
- [ ] Move this possibly. It's kind of metadata, but it's also dealt
  with totally differently. Maybe it is totally different.

** TODO [[file:lib/scrunch/meta.rb::def%20self.apply_metadata(file,%20metadata,%20cover)][Meta.apply_metadata]]
- [ ] Change this method to something like Meta.write.
- [ ] Oh god it's ugly. Make it less that.

** TODO [[file:lib/scrunch/transcode.rb::def%20self.crush_file(input_file,%20output_file)][Transcode.crush_file]]
- [ ] Rename this to Transcode.crush or something.

** TODO Shell rm
- [ ] Change Main.run so that it deletes the cover with ruby instead
  of a shell script: [[file:lib/scrunch/main.rb::system%20"rm%20\"#{cover}\""][Shell rm]]
